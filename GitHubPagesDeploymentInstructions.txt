Step-by-step guide to build, test, and deploy your React app to GitHub Pages:

1. Build the React app locally:
   - Open your terminal in the project root directory.
   - Run: npm run build
   - This will create a 'dist' or 'build' folder with the static files.

2. Test the build locally:
   - You can use a simple static server to test the build.
   - For example, install serve globally if you don't have it:
     npm install -g serve
   - Run:
     serve -s dist
   - Open the URL shown (usually http://localhost:5000) in your browser to verify the site.

3. Prepare your GitHub repository:
   - Make sure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.
   - If not, initialize git and push:
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
     git push -u origin main

4. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   Option A: Using gh-pages branch (recommended)
   - Install gh-pages package if not installed:
     npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   - Add these scripts to your package.json:
     "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
     }
   - Run:
     npm run deploy
   - This will build and push the dist folder to the gh-pages branch.
   - In your GitHub repo settings, enable GitHub Pages from the gh-pages branch.

   Option B: Manual deployment
   - Build the app (npm run build).
   - Copy the contents of the dist folder to a separate folder.
   - Push that folder to a branch like gh-pages or main/docs.
   - Configure GitHub Pages in repo settings to serve from that branch/folder.

5. Access your site:
   - After deployment, your site will be available at:
     https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/

6. Notes:
   - Make sure your routing uses HashRouter as updated for GitHub Pages compatibility.
   - If you update the site, run npm run deploy again to update GitHub Pages.
